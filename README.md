# Simple-Python3-Emulator-For-Github-IO
I use this to host my python3 programs on github. I uses pyodide library. It's a highly useful low complexity solution that saves me actual money as I don't have to go pay for a service like trinket to run and share my python 3 webapps on web. Feel free to fork and raise PRs if you have any changes in mind.
